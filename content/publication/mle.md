In this lecture we will show how to use  projection matrices to find the maximum likelihood estimates of $\beta$ in a Gaussian linear model, avoiding the use of derivatives, but instead taking a geometric approach.

Matrix Algebra Review from [StatSci Boot Camp](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/MathBootcamp2017/blob/master/Handouts/02_Matrices.pdf)

Please review the material in Chapter 1 of Christensen on expectations of vectors and matrices before class.
