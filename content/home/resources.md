### JAGS


JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of
Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation  not wholly unlike BUGS. The name is a misnomer as JAGS
implements more than just Gibbs Samplers.
JAGS was written with three aims in mind:

* To have a cross-platform engine for the BUGS language
* To be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions, distributions and samplers.
* To be a plaftorm for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling

Resources for JAGS:

* [JAGS website on Sourceforge for Downloads, Manuals, etc](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net)
* [JAGS News](https://martynplummer.wordpress.com)  Martin Plummer's
* site for all things JAGS
* [rjags on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/)

### Emacs

Using emacs as an editor for R, C/C++, LaTeX provides a great environment for editing, compiling and debugging - you can even use it as a shell!

* [emacs reference card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf)
* [Emacs Speaks Statistics](http://ess.r-project.org) is an add-on package for GNU Emacs and XEmacs. It is designed to support editing of scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis programs such as R, S-Plus, SAS, Stata and OpenBUGS/JAGS. Although all users of these statistical analysis programs are welcome to apply ESS, advanced users or professionals who regularly work with text-based statistical analysis scripts, with various statistical languages/programs, or with different operating systems might benefit from it the most.
