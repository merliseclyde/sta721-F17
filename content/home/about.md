## Course Description

This course introduces students to Gaussian linear models and
extensions for model building, including exploratory data analysis
techniques, variable transformations and selection, parameter
estimation and interpretation, prediction, hierarchical models, model
selection and Bayesian model averaging. The concepts of linear models
will be covered from Bayesian and classical viewpoints. Topics in
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation will be introduced as required,
however it is expected that students have either taken STA 601 or are
co-registed.

All students should be extremely comfortable with linear/matrix algebra and
mathematical statistics at the level of STA 611 (Statistical Inference
- Casella and Berger is an excellent resource).  If you need to
review linear algebra, please explore material under  [Resources](#resources)

### Computation 
You should have access to a laptop or desktop capable of
  running [RStudio/R](#resources).  We will use R as a programming language
  at later stages for data analysis and use existing packages written
  in R to support the course.  See the [Resources](#resources) page
  for books and other reseources for learning R. You should bring a calculator to exams. There is no  restrictions on the type of calculator (but not on a mobile device)

### Discussion Forums

We will be using
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/duke/fall2017/sta72101f17/home) for class
discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing
questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza (peer answers earn participation points!). If you
have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
team@piazza.com.

Find our class page at:
